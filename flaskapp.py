    You are a teacher preparing questions for a quiz. Given the following document, please generate 10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with 4 options and a corresponding
answer letter based on the document. Make the questions such that the answers aren't the same letter for every question. Make at least 3 questions multiple choice.
Make questions with longer answers, that does not include names.
Example question, use only the structure below to give the response:
Question: question here
CHOICE_A: choice here
CHOICE_B: choice here
CHOICE_C: choice here
CHOICE_D: choice here
